# 42 C++ Modules

![image](https://github.com/fv99/42_cpp_modules/assets/108353744/0e363e22-ed1e-483a-9303-cfba031d4568)

## **Rules:**

- Compile your code with c++ and the flags -Wall -Wextra -Werror
- Your code should still compile if you add the flag -std=c++98
- You are allowed to use almost everything from the standard library. Use as much as possible the C++-ish versions of the C functions you are used to.
- You canâ€™t use any other external library. It means C++11 (and derived forms) and Boost libraries are forbidden.
    - The following functions are forbidden too: *printf(), *alloc() and free()
    - Unless explicitly stated otherwise, using namespace <ns_name> and friend keywords are forbidden
- You are allowed to use the STL in the Module 08 and 09 only. That means:
    - No Containers (vector/list/map/and so forth)
    - no Algorithms (anything that requires to include the <algorithm> header)
